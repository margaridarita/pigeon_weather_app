## Pigeon Weather App
This was my first ever coding project, done for the SheCodes Plus Web Development Workshop. It uses a weather API so that you can search the weather and week's forecast for any city.

Looking back there is a lot that I could improve on the code, but I'm proud to leave it saved as it is to reflect my evolution.
