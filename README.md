## Pigeon Weather App
This was my first ever coding project. It was done in 2 weeks for the SheCodes Plus Web Development Workshop. It uses a weather API so that the user can search the weather and week's forecast for any city. Feel free to check the result on the Netfly website.

Looking back, there are a lot of improvements that could be done on the code, but I would like to leave it saved as it was to reflect my evolution.
